Hi there, I'm FanHua 👋. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Electronic and Information Engineering, and I’m passionate about Linux, microcontroller (MCU) development, and indie game creation.

I often write chip drivers, reimplement and learn from open-source projects, and develop small indie games in my spare time, focusing on the combination of embedded hardware, low-level code, and creative development.
